Some random F# code examples

Functional programming is often regarded as the best-kept secret of scientific modelers, mathematicians, 
artificial intelligence researchers, financial institutions, graphic designers, CPU designers, 
compiler programmers, and telecommunications engineers. Understandably, functional programming languages 
tend to be used in settings that perform heavy number crunching, abstract symbolic processing, or theorem proving. 

Of course, while F# is abstract enough to satisfy the needs of some highly technical niches, 
its simple and expressive syntax makes it suitable for CRUD apps, web pages, GUIs, games, 
and general-purpose programming.

As a .NET language, F# code compiles down to Common Language Infrastructure (CLI) byte code or 
Microsoft Intermediate Language (MSIL) which runs on top of the Common Language Runtime (CLR). 

All .NET languages share this common intermediate state which allows them to easily interoperate with one another 
and use the .NET Framework's Base Class Library (BCL).
